#Purpose

GeoSnap is a one of a kind geotagging app that helps photographers to quickly and easily tag the exact location that they took a photo. There have been many geotagging apps over the years, but most are poorly designed and have weak functionality. GeoSnap aims to remedy the problems that these other apps have by combining modern design with ease of use. This project includes a working clickable prototype and a responsive website along with the app (as seen in a mockup). This repository is for the simple bootstrap site to help show off the app concept.
